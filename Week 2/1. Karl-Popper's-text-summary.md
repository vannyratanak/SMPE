### *Summary of [Karl Popper's Conjectures and Refutations](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2024_10_Grenoble/02_reading_Popper_Conjectures-and-refutation.pdf)*

In "Conjectures and Refutations", Karl Popper explains falsifiability is the key criterion that distinguishes scientific theories from non-scientific ones. A scientific theory must make risky predictions that can be tested and possibly proven wrong by evidence. If a theory cannot be refuted by any possible observation, it is not scientific.

Popper contrasts genuine science, like Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity, which can be tested and potentially falsified, with pseudosciences like Marxism and Freudian psychoanalysis, which explain everything but can never be refuted. He argues that science progresses by proposing theories and subjecting them to tests designed to disprove them. Falsification, not verification, is what advances scientific knowledge.
